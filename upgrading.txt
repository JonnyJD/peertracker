PeerTracker - Simple, Efficient and Fast BitTorent Tracker
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since PeerTracker is so small, there is not much that goes into upgrading from 
one release to the next. However, there could be small table changes in the 
database schema for example and it might cause some problems.

I'd suggest you run ./help.php that comes with PeerTracker after uploading the 
new files to your server. It has some utility functions that will allow it to
wipe the database and re-create the new structures.
